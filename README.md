- Styled components helps write css in the scope of the component. For more, read [here](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#getting-started).


### Eslint

Eslint is shipped in by default in react-create-app. However, you can customisize your rules in the `.eslintrc` file. 

I integrated `Prettier` with the project as unifed formatting tool. It automatically format code on save.
